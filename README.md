## About

### Data

#### Items identification

The identification of the items (products) is based on their `productID` only. However, since products are organised within different categories, the `categoryID` is kept in the parsing process so this parsing is made less heavy. For instance, there is no need to parse an entire category to retrieve a product if it's not a part of it).

### HTML

The main page is generated with [Handlebars.js](https://handlebarsjs.com/). The cart is generated 

### CSS

#### Naming

The CSS naming method is called BEM.
