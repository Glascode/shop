# The Shop

A minimal shopping page, generated with Handlebars.js.

## Installation

The site can work totally statically. Just go to the index.html in your
favourite browser and let Handlebars do its thing.

## Items identification

The identification of the items (products) is based on their `categoryID` *and*
their `productID` since it was first considered that a product ID was depending
on the category it belonged to. This method may change for a product to be
identifiable with its `productID` only.
